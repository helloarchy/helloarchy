### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm a senior software engineer, using C# and C++. I have a broad experience as a full stack developer, 
using .NET, Blazor, React and Azure. I see projects through the whole lifecycle, from architecture to
deployment, using the full DevOps process.

ðŸ”­ Lately I've been focusing on simulations and virtual development with C++ and C#, with a strong
focus on performance for real-time applications.

ðŸŒ± In my free time I've been making games with both Unreal Engine and Unity. I also have an online 
microservice system for various personal projects. It's a large .NET microservice hosted on Azure with 
various front ends for a wide range of different web applications that I use for different utilities 
in my personal life.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my other personal projects, a lot of my repos are private. I also have many different
projects which I host on my personal Azure DevOps, or self host as they're too large for GitHub. Many
of which are Unreal and Unity Cloud projects using their respective DevOps solutions.
