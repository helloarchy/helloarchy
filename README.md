### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I'm a software engineer, using C# and C++. I have a broad experience as a full stack developer, using .NET
and either React or Blazor. I have experience taking projects through the entire lifecycle, using Azure
as a DevOps engineer, including infrastructure as code with Teraform and Bicep.

ðŸ”­ Lately I've been focusing on simulation and virtual development with C++ and C#, with a strong
focus on performance for real-time projects.

ðŸŒ± In my free time I've been making games with both Unreal Engine and Unity. I also have an online system for
various personal projects. It's a large .NET microservice hosted on Azure with various front ends
for a wide range of different web applications that I use for different utilities in my personal life.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mt other personal projects, a lot of the repo's are private. I also have many different
projects which I host on Azure as they're too large for GitHub. Many of which are Unreal projects.
